# GOG-random-game

Have you ever wanted to play a game but couldn't decide which one to play? Let your computer make the decision for you!
This program selects a random game from all of your owned games in the GOG Galaxy 2.0 launcher.
GOG Galaxy 2.0 integrates with all your other game launchers to have all your games in one place, so this program should be selecting from among every game you own.
The Galaxy database should be in its default location (C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db)

I originally created this program in python, and then re-created it as a WPF app to get some practice with C#
